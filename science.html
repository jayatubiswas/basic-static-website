        Welcome!

    <p>
        Being one of the most sought after Higher Education Institutions in India, Government College Of Engineering &
        Ceramic Technology takes pride in introducing a journal named SCIENTIFIC VOYAGE that throws light on significant
        areas in Science, Engineering, Management and Technology. The journal enables publication of pre-eminent
        research work by Researchers, Acamedicians, and Scientists pertaining to varied disciplines.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Goverment College of Engineering & Ceramic Technology was established in 1941 by Professor Sasadhar Ray who was
        an eminent and educationist and the first Principal of the college. At that time the college was named as Bengal
        Ceramic Institute Calcutta, which later on flowered into College of Ceramic Technology. Professor Ray was one of
        the pioneers in spreading ceramic education in India. He obtained his M.Sc. degree in Physics in 1930, as a
        student of Prof. Satyendranath Bose, from the University of Dacca having been place first in Class. He was a
        research scholar under Prof. K. S. Krishnan-F.R.S. in the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science and
        served as a supervisor in Peripatetic Demonstration for Scheme of the Govt. of Bengal to popularize the ceramic
        manufacturing processes in the villages. He also worked for a brief period in the Industrial Research
        Laboratory, Dept. of Industries, Government of West Bengal.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The college started with certificate and diploma courses in Ceramic Technology with six other different courses
        to train people for various ceramic industries in the eastern and other regions of India. Prof. Roy organized a
        commercial Training- cum- Production unit at the institute to provide employment through practical training to
        the students. He formulated many developmental schemes with their successful implementation and introduced the
        concept of self- employment in the institute to cope with the problem of growing unemployment in the country. He
        was the pioneer in India to manufacture bone chinawares using indigenous raw materials on commercial basis and
        glazed pottery, sanitary wares, tiles and low-tension insulators from Gangetic silt. His contribution to ceramic
        education and industry has gone for and near within India and round the globe.
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        In the year 1962, B. Sc (Tech.) degree course in Ceramic Technology under the University of Calcutta was
        introduced in the institute, which was then renamed as College of Ceramic Technology and was undertaken by the
        Govt. of West Bengal. At that time more emphasis was given on Traditional Ceramics. Traditional consists of
        pottery including materials, cement, etc. and traditional glasses for windows and containers/bottles including
        crystal glasses and of course the infamous optical glasses for our eyes and cameras.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        This college has seen the addition of two new B.Tech courses in Information Technology and Computer Science &
        Engineering which was initiated under the West Bengal University of Technology in the year 2000 and 2001 as well
        as the M.Tech course in Ceramic Technology which was introduced in the year 2006. The B.Tech and M.Tech courses
        of Ceramic Technology and the B.Tech course in Information Technology has already been accredited by the
        National Board of Accreditation (NBA). The institute has also recently gained approval from AICTE to begin the
        M. Tech. course in Information Technology.
