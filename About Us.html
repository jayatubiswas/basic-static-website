        An educational institute is a place where young minds are nurtured in the best possible way, where their skills
        are developed in a specific field. A good foothold is therefore essential, and the Govt. College of Engineering
        & Ceramic Technology is such an institute, where students are given the best platform to exhibit their talents.
        We take this opportunity, to introduce ourselves, as one of the leading government engineering colleges under
        the Department of Higher Education in the eastern part of India.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        From its humble beginning as the Bengal Ceramic Institute in 1942, renamed as the College of Ceramic Technology
        in 1962, and further renamed as the Govt. College of Engineering & Ceramic Technology in 2005, the college is
        entering the 80th glorious year of its academic life. It is indeed a time to celebrate, to introspect, to
        consolidate and to plan for its future. The uniqueness of this institute is that, it is the oldest institute for
        imparting technical education in Ceramic Science and Engineering, in the Eastern Part of India and the only
        institute offering a full fledged Undergraduate and Postgraduate course in Ceramic Technology in the state of
        West Bengal. This college has seen the addition of two new B.Tech courses in Information Technology and Computer
        Science & Engineering which was initiated under
    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        The West Bengal University of Technology in the year 2000 and 2001 as well as the M.Tech course in Ceramic
        Technology which was introduced in the year 2006. The B.Tech and M.Tech courses of Ceramic Technology and the
        B.Tech course in Information Technology has already been accredited by the National Board of Accreditation
        (NBA).
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The college has reached its magnificence under the admirable guidance and leadership of eminent academicians of
        international repute. The institute is presently headed by Prof.(Dr.) Saikat Maitra, under whose able guidance
        and leadership, the institute has been able to make commendable achievements.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        The academic program of this institute presently comprises of the mentioned B.Tech courses which has an intake
        of 48 students each and M.Tech course with an intake of 18 students. The institute has recently gained approval
        from AICTE to begin the M. Tech. course in Information Technology with a sanctioned intake of 18 students. The
        institute can boast of well equipped workshop and laboratories, which is essential for the scheduled academic
        curriculum and research activities operational at the institute. Besides other departmental laboratories,
        special mention is needed for sophisticated and specialized labs developed such as the Thin Film lab,
        Nano-Materials and Sol-gel Lab of the Ceramic Department and VLSI, Image Processing, GIS and the Computer Vision
        Lab of the Information Technology department. Another feather in the cap is the addition of a most modern
        Language Lab for English Communication Skill & Personality Development as well as the EDUSAT lab with Virtual
        Learning capability of our students. It is worth mentioning that the entire campus is connected to the internet
        for 24 hours through NKN Leased Line (100 mbps) connectivity which is accessible from all computers in the
        institute.

    </p>

    <br>
    <p>
        The Institute has highly qualified faculty members where 35% of them are Doctorate Degree Holders. The rest are
        Post Graduate Degree holders out of which most of them are pursuing their Ph.D degrees. Over the last five
        years, the college has produced 5 Ph.Ds from both engineering and science departments. The faculty has
        contributed more than 100 research papers and presentations in Indian as well as International journals.
        Besides, several Research & Development projects sponsored by D.S.T, U.G.C, AICTE etc are running some of which
        have been successfully completed. All these accomplishments definitely prove that this institute is a ground for
        nurturing intellects.
    </p>
    <br>

        The Institute has collaborated with reputed institutions at national and international level for postgraduate,
        project and Ph.D programmes.The Petronus University of Malaysia, Northern University in Saudi Arabia, Curtin
        University in Australia, Jadavpur University, Calcutta University, Presidency University, CGCRI, Saha Institute
        of Nuclear Physics are the ones to name a few. The institute has undertaken different technical training
        programmes for the self employment of the unemployed youth under Services to the Community and Economy Scheme of
        World Bank funded Project TEQIP. The institute also promotes active students participation in NSS programme. It
        is also worth mentioning that college is about to get academic autonomy from the University Grants Commission

        Examination. The successful students to have qualified the GATE examination this year has been about 45% in the
        Ceramic department, 40% in Computer Science & Engg and about 25% in Information Technology departments. The
        final year students of Ceramic Technology has already undergone 100% recruitment in various renowned companies
        like Saint Gobain Glass, Jindal South West Steel., Essar Steel, Steel Authority of India., Grindwell Norton,
        MECON, Tata Refractories and more. The students of final year, IT and CSE departments have also been successful
        in getting through software giants such as TCS., Cognizant ,Wipro, Infosys, Tech. Mahindra, Accenture, Tata
        Elxsi and many more. Many of the students of this institute are pursuing higher studies in reputed national
        institutions like the IITs and NITs and many have gone abroad to Universities like Sheffield, University of
        Florida, University of Washington, Arizona State University, Drexel University (Pennsylvania), University of
        Cincinnati to name a few.
    </p>
    <br>
    <p>
        Over the years the college has grown and learnt to dream. It strives hard to become a “Centre of Excellence” in
